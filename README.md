## What is IAM Zero?

IAM Zero detects identity and access management issues and automatically suggests least-privilege policies. It does this by capturing errors in applications you build or commands that you run which use. By detecting the error and matching it against our Access Advisory lists IAM Zero can instantly provide a least-privilege policy recommendation, customised to your cloud environment.

IAM Zero currently works for AWS but our roadmap includes other cloud platforms like GCP, Azure, and Kubernetes.
